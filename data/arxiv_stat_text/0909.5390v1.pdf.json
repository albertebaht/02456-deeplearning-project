Suppose that\ninstruments are available and Z represents an identi\ufb01ed projection of X\non the instruments so that additionally X\u2217= Z \u2212U; assume that U is\nindependent of Z (Berkson-type error from using the instruments) and that\nE[\u2206Y |Z, U ]\n=\n0;\nE[\u2206X |Z, U, \u2206Y ]\n=\n0;\nE(U)\n=\n0.\nThese assumptions were made by e.g. Hausman et al. (1991) who examined\npolynomial regression. Newey (2001) added another moment condition for es-\ntimation in semiparametric regression leading to two equations for unknown\ng and F, the measurement error distribution (all integrals over (\u2212\u221e, \u221e)) :\nE(Y |Z\n=\nz) =\nZ\ng(z \u2212u)dF(u);\nE(Y X|Z\n=\nz) =\nZ\n(z \u2212u)g(z \u2212u)dF(u).\n3\nDe\ufb01ne Wy(z) \u2261E(Y |Z = z); Wxy(z) \u2261E(Y (Z \u2212X)|Z = z). The model\nassumptions then can be considered in terms of classes of functions Wy, Wxy, g\nand distribution F that satisfy the equations:\nWy(z)\n=\nZ\ng(z \u2212u)dF(u);\n(1)\nWxy(z)\n=\nZ\n(z \u2212u)g(z \u2212u)dF(u);\nwe say that these functions Wy, Wxy, g , F satisfy model assumptions. The\nfunctions g and F enter in convolutions; this motivates using Fourier trans-\nforms (Ft). Fourier transforms:\n\u03b5y(\u03b6)\n=\nFt(Wy(\u00b7));\n(2)\n\u03b5xy(\u03b6)\n=\nFt(Wxy(\u00b7));\n\u03b3(\u03b6)\n=\nFt(g(\u00b7));\nthe characteristic function is obtained as \u03c6(\u03b6) =\nR\nei\u03b6udF(u).\nProvided that for some subclass of functions Fourier transforms are well\nde\ufb01ned, derivatives exist and the convolution theorem applies, (1) is equiva-\nlent to a system with two unknown functions, \u03b3, \u03c6 :\n\u03b5y(\u03b6)\n=\n\u03b3(\u03b6)\u03c6(\u03b6);\n(3)\ni\u03b5xy(\u03b6)\n=\n\u00b7\u03b3(\u03b6)\u03c6(\u03b6),\n(4)\nwhere\n\u00b7\u03b3 = d\u03b3\nd\u03b6 . S. Schennach (2007) (S) suggested that these equations can\nbe justi\ufb01ed for a wide class of functions if one uses generalized functions,\nspeci\ufb01cally, those in the space of tempered distributions, T \u2032 (de\ufb01ned below\nin section 2.1)1.\nAssumption 1.\nThe functions g, Wy, Wxy that satisfy the model as-\n1A referee pointed out that the usual notation for the space of tempered distributions\nis S\u2032, but here we follow the notation in (S).\n4\nsumptions are such that each represents an element in the space of tempered\ndistributions, T \u2032.\nSome examples of such functions are the class considered in (S, As-\nsumption 1): functions such that |g(x\u2217)| , |Wy(z)| , |Wxy(z)| are de\ufb01ned and\nbounded by polynomials on R. However, the assumption here allows for very\nwide classes of functions. This class may be di\ufb03cult to characterize explicitly;\nthe Assumption 1\u2019 below provides an important subclass of locally integrable\nfunctions in T \u2032.\nConsider functions b(t) for t \u2208R that satisfy\nZ\n(1 + t2)\u2212l |b(t)| dt < \u221efor some l \u22650.\n(5)\nAssumption 1\u2019.\nThe functions g, Wy, Wxy that satisfy the model as-\nsumptions are such that each satis\ufb01es (5).\nThe functions g, Wy, Wxy that satisfy (5) satisfy Assumption 1. Any func-\ntion in the space L1 of absolutely integrable functions satis\ufb01es Assumption\n1\u2019 here but not the Assumption 1 in (S) unless the function is everywhere\nbounded.\nWhile the assumption in (S) extends to polynomial regression\nfunctions or distribution functions for binary choice models (where Ft do not\nexist in the ordinary sense), a regression function that is unbounded at some\npoints is not allowed. There are cases where such properties may arise, e.g.\nfor some hazard functions, for liquidity trap; the more general assumption\nhere accommodates such cases.\nFourier transform is a continuous invertible operator in T \u2032, all tempered\ndistributions are di\ufb00erentiable in T \u2032 (thus\n\u00b7\u03b3 is de\ufb01ned). Fourier transform\nof an ordinary function of the type considered here may no longer be an\nordinary function (e.g. Ft(const) = \u03b4, the Dirac delta-function that cannot\nbe represented as an ordinary function), and thus is not de\ufb01ned point-wise;\nthus the notation \u03b3(\u03b6), etc. for the Ft in e.g. (3,4) which we keep here\nfor convenience refers just to the generalized function \u03b3 without necessarily\n5\ngiving meaning to values at a point.\nIn the class of functions that satis\ufb01es the model assumptions denote by\nA the subclass of functions (g, F), by A\u2217the subclass of functions (g); the\nmapping P : A \u2192A\u2217is given by P(g, F) = g. Denote by B the class of\nfunctions (Wy, Wxy).\nEquations (1) of model assumptions map A into B\n(mapping M : A \u2192B); Fourier transforms map B into Ft(B), the class\nof functions that are Fourier transforms of functions from B; if equations\n(3,4) could be solved they would provide solutions \u03c6\u2217= \u03c6I(\u03b3 \u0338= 0) (where\nI(A) = 1 if A is true, zero otherwise) and \u03b3\u2217if \u03c6 \u0338= 0; applying inverse\nFourier transform would give g\u2217= Ft\u22121(\u03b3\u2217). This sequence of mappings can\nbe represented as follows:\nA\n(g,F )\nM\n\u2192\nB\n(Wy,Wxy)\nF t\n\u2192Ft(B)\n(\u03b5y,\u03b5xy)\nS\u2192Ft( \u02dcA)\n(\u03c6\u2217,\u03b3\u2217)\n\u2192Ft(A\u2217)\n(\u03b3\u2217)\nF t\u22121\n\u2192A\u2217\n(g\u2217).\n(6)\nIf (6) provides the same result as P so that g\u2217\u2261g (and \u03b3\u2217\u2261\u03b3) then g can\nbe identi\ufb01ed from the functions (Wy, Wxy) with the identi\ufb01cation mapping\nM\u2217: B \u2192A\u2217\n(7)\ngiven by composition of the last \ufb01ve mappings in (6). The most challenging\npart is in solving the equations to establish the mapping (for \u03b3\u2217\u2261\u03b3)\nS : Ft(B)\n(\u03b5y,\u03b5xy)\n\u2192Ft( \u02dcA)\n(\u03c6\u2217,\u03b3)\n(8)\nTwo additional assumptions are similar to those in (S) and are standard.\nAssumption 2. The function \u03c6(\u03b6) is continuous, continuously di\ufb00eren-\ntiable on R; and \u03c6(\u03b6) \u0338= 0.\nIn terms of the model this implies a further condition that absolute mo-\nment of U exist.\nAssumption 3. Support of generalized function \u03b3 coincides with |\u03b6| \u2264\n\u00af\u03b6 where \u00af\u03b6 > 0 and could be in\ufb01nite.\n6\nUnder Assumptions 1-3 identi\ufb01cation is possible as shown in Theorem 1\nof this paper; the theorem in (S) asserts an analytic formula (S, (13)) that\nrelies on a decomposition that may not hold.\nWhen the errors-in-variables problem is examined in the space of tem-\npered distributions the corresponding (weak) topology is that of the space\nT \u2032; in that topology the mappings Ft, Ft\u22121 are known to be continuous,\nhowever, the mapping (8) may be discontinuous, rendering the identi\ufb01ca-\ntion mapping (7) discontinuous as well thus implying ill-posedness of the\nproblem. One reason for this is that a too thin-tailed characteristic func-\ntion may mask high-frequency components in the Fourier transform of the\nregression function. Theorem 1 here provides a condition under which con-\ntinuity obtains. When identi\ufb01cation is provided by a continuous mapping\nnonparametric plug-in estimation is possible as long as Fourier transforms\nof the conditional moment functions can be consistently estimated in T \u2032;\nthis applies e.g. if the regression function is in the L1 space; Proposition 2\nestablishes this result.\nIdenti\ufb01cation in classes of parametric functions requires that the mapping\nfrom the parameter space to the function space be (at least locally) invert-\nible. (S) uses generalized functions to widen classes of parametric functions\nfor which identi\ufb01cation is provided by a \ufb01nite number of moment condi-\ntions; in particular she expands classes of L1 functions to which the results\nof Wang and Hsiao (1995, 2009) apply and also allows sums of such func-\ntions with polynomial functions, where before polynomial functions were\nconsidered only by themselves in Hausman et al. (1991). Her results rely\non existence of a moment generating function for the measurement error\nand use special weighting functions (some of which are improperly de\ufb01ned).\nHere general classes of functions where such identi\ufb01cation is achievable are\nexplicitly characterized rather than via existence of moments conditions (as\nin S, Assumption 6), the requirement of a moment generating function for\nmeasurement error is avoided; appropriate weighting functions are given.\n7\nSection 2 deals with identi\ufb01cation and well-posedness in the non-parametric\ncase. Section 3 examines identi\ufb01cation for the semiparametric model. Proofs\nare in Appendix A. Appendix B provides an explanation of the claims about\nthe main errors in (S).\n2\nNon-parametric identi\ufb01cation\nIn the \ufb01rst part of this section known results on generalized functions that\ncon\ufb01rm the existence and continuity of some of the mappings in (6) are\nprovided, in particular, for the Fourier transform and its inverse. Other map-\npings, such as (8) require special treatment because they involve multiplica-\ntion of generalized functions. Multiplication in spaces of generalized functions\ncannot be de\ufb01ned (Schwartz\u2019s impossibility result, 1954, see also Kaminski\nand Rudnicki (1991) for examples) although there are cases when speci\ufb01c\nproducts are known to exist. Here conditions under which some generalized\nfunctions can be multiplied by some continuous functions to obtain general-\nized functions are provided. With this additional insight the existence and\ncontinuity of the mappings can be examined.\nIn the second part of this\nsection the identi\ufb01cation result is proved and su\ufb03cient conditions for the\nidenti\ufb01cation mapping to be continuous are provided. A proposition about\nconsistent (in topology of T \u2032) nonparametric estimation that in particular\napplies to functions in space L1 completes this section.\n2.1\nResults about generalized functions and existence\nand continuity of mappings\nAll the known results in this section are in Schwartz (1966), Gel\u2019fand and\nShilov\u2019s monograph (vol.1 and 2, 1964) - (GS) and in Lighthill (1959)- (L);\nthey are listed for the convenience of the reader. The sequential approach\nof Mikusinski in Antonisek et al (1973) is also referred to here. A somewhat\n8\ndistinct approach to multiplication by a continuous function in the space of\ngeneralized functions is developed at the end of this section to explain the\nvalidity of some of the mappings in (6).\nDe\ufb01nitions of generalized function spaces usually start with a topological\nlinear space of well-behaved \u201dtest functions\u201d, G. Two most widely used spaces\nare G = D and G = T (usually denoted S in the literature). The linear\ntopological space of in\ufb01nitely di\ufb00erentiable functions with \ufb01nite support D \u2282\nC\u221e(R), where C\u221e(R) is the space of all in\ufb01nitely di\ufb00erentiable functions;\nconvergence is de\ufb01ned for a sequence of functions that are zero outside a\ncommon bounded set and converge uniformly together with derivatives of all\norders. The space T \u2282C\u221e(R) of test functions is de\ufb01ned as:\nT =\n\u001a\ns \u2208C\u221e(R) :\n\f\f\f\f\ndks(t)\ndtk\n\f\f\f\f = O(|t|\u2212l) as t \u2192\u221e, for integer k \u22650, l > 0\n\u001b\n,\nk = 0 corresponds to the function itself; |\u00b7| is the absolute value;\nthese\nfunctions go to zero faster than any power. A sequence in T converges if in\nevery bounded region the product of |t|l (for any l) with any order derivative\nconverges uniformly.\nA generalized function, b, is de\ufb01ned by an equivalence class of weakly\nconverging sequences of test functions in G :\nb =\n\u001a\n{bn} : bn \u2208G, such that for any s \u2208G, lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nZ\nbn(t)s(t)dt = (b, s) < \u221e\n\u001b\n.\nAn alternative equivalent de\ufb01nition is that b is a linear continuous functional\non G with values de\ufb01ned by (b, s)2. The linear topological space of generalized\nfunctions is denoted G\u2032; the topology is that of convergence of values of\nfunctionals for any converging sequence of test functions (weak topology);\nG\u2032 is complete in that topology. For G = D or T the spaces are D\u2032 and T \u2032,\n2As a referee pointed out this is the more commonly used de\ufb01nition of generalized func-\ntion; the one above (used by S) is a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition and thus represents\nan equivalent characterization.\n9\ncorrespondingly. It is easily established that D \u2282T; T \u2032 \u2282D\u2032 and that D\u2032\nhas a weaker topology than T \u2032, meaning that any sequence that converges in\nT \u2032 converges in D\u2032, but there are sequences that converge in D\u2032, but not in\nT \u2032. The space T \u2032 is also called the space of tempered distributions.\nAny generalized function b in T \u2032 or\nD\u2032 is (weakly) in\ufb01nitely di\ufb00eren-\ntiable: the generalized function b(k) is the k \u2212th order generalized derivative\nde\ufb01ned by (b(k), s) = (\u22121)k (b, s(k)). The di\ufb00erentiation operator is continu-\nous in these spaces. For any probability distribution function F on Rk the\ndensity function exists as a generalized function (see e.g., Zinde-Walsh, 2008)\nand continuously depends on the distribution function, thus the generalized\nderivative of F, generalized density function f, is in T \u2032.\nAny locally summable (integrable on any bounded set) function b(t) de-\n\ufb01nes a generalized function b in D\u2032 by\n(b, s) =\nZ\nb(t)s(t)dt;\n(9)\nany such function that additionally satis\ufb01es (5) similarly by (9) de\ufb01nes a gen-\neralized function b in T \u2032. A distinction between functions in the ordinary sense\n(a pointwise mapping from the domain of de\ufb01nition into the reals or complex\nnumbers) and generalized functions is that generalized functions are not de-\n\ufb01ned pointwise. Generalized functions de\ufb01ned via (9) by ordinary functions\nb(t) are called regular functions; we can refer to them as ordinary regular\nfunctions in G\u2032. The functions F, g, Wy, Wxy are ordinary regular functions\nin T \u2032 (and thus in D\u2032) if they satisfy Assumption 1\u2019.\nIf a generalized function b is such that a representation (9) does not hold,\nit is said that b is singular, so any b \u2208G\u2032 is either regular or singular. A well-\nknown singular generalized function is the \u03b4\u2212function: \u03b4 : (\u03b4, s) = s(0). Any\ngeneralized function in D\u2032 or T \u2032 is a generalized \ufb01nite order derivative of a\ncontinuous function. An ordinary function that de\ufb01nes a generalized function\nis regular if it integrates to a continuous function and singular otherwise.\n10\nFor example, the ordinary function b(t) = |t|\u22123\n2 de\ufb01nes a singular generalized\nfunction; it does not integrate to a continuous function; it does not satisfy\n(9), in fact (see GS, v.1, p.51) it de\ufb01nes a generalized function by\n(b, s) =\nZ \u221e\n0\nt\u22123\n2 {s(t) + s(\u2212t) \u22122s(0)} dt.\n(10)\nNo special treatment is needed to consider complex-valued generalized\nfunctions; all the same properties hold. For s \u2208T or D Fourier transform\nFt(s) =\nR\ns(t)eit\u03b6dt exists and is in T. For b \u2208T \u2032 : (Ft(b), s) = (b, Ft(s)),\nso Ft(b) \u2208T \u2032. Fourier transform de\ufb01nes a continuous and continuously in-\nvertible linear operator in T \u2032 (but not for D\u2032). Thus Fourier transforms of\nWy, Wxy, g, and of the generalized derivative, f, of F exist in T \u2032 and their\ninverse Fourier transforms coincide with the original functions. Since all the\nfunctions are di\ufb00erentiable as generalized functions\n\u00b7\u03b3 exists in T \u2032. By As-\nsumption 2 the characteristic function \u03c6 is continuous, as is its derivative,\n\u00b7\n\u03c6;\nthey are regular ordinary functions in T \u2032.\nSince G\u2032 does not have a multiplicative structure, products and convolu-\ntions can be de\ufb01ned for speci\ufb01c pairs only and generally exist only for special\nclasses. The product between a generalized function in T \u2032 and a function\nfrom C\u221ewith all derivatives bounded by polynomial functions exists. This\nclass of multipliers is denoted by OM. Convolution of Fourier transforms of\ngeneralized functions with Fourier transforms of functions from OM exists\nand the convolution theorem applies. Products and convolutions may ex-\nist for other speci\ufb01c pairs of generalized functions. When such convolutions\nand products of their Fourier transforms exist as generalized functions the\nconvolution theorem similarly applies to such pairs.\nConvolution Theorem.\nIf for b1, b2 \u2208T \u2032, convolution b1 \u2217b2 \u2208T \u2032,\nproduct Ft(b1) \u00b7 Ft(b2) \u2208T \u2032, then Ft(b1 \u2217b2) = Ft(b1) \u00b7 Ft(b2).\nThe proof of this theorem uses exactly the same sequential argument\nas in Antonisek et al (1973), where it utilized the speci\ufb01c delta-convergent\n11\nsequences; the only di\ufb00erence here is that the argument can be applied to\nany sequence in the equivalence class that de\ufb01nes every given generalized\nfunction.\nTo consider the product of a generalized function with a continuous func-\ntion that may not be in\ufb01nitely di\ufb00erentiable, the property that the product\ndoes not depend on the sequence that de\ufb01nes the generalized function has\nto be made a requirement. We thus say that ab for b \u2208G\u2032 and continuous a\nis de\ufb01ned in G\u2032 if for any sequence bn from the equivalence class of b there\nexists a sequence (ab)n in G such that for any \u03c8 \u2208G\nlim\nZ\na(x)bn(x)\u03c8(x)dx exists and equals lim\nZ\n(ab)n (x)\u03c8(x)dx.\n(11)\nDenote by 0n a zero-convergent sequence that belongs to the equivalence\nclass de\ufb01ning the function that is identically zero in G\u2032.\nProposition 1 For the product ab between a continuous function a and\nb \u2208G\u2032 to be de\ufb01ned in G\u2032 it is necessary and su\ufb03cient that (i) (11) hold for\nsome sequence \u02dcbn in the class that de\ufb01nes b and (ii) for any zero-convergent\nsequence, 0n(x),\nlim\nZ\na(x)0n(x)\u03c8(x)dx = 0.\n(12)\nProof.\nAny sequence bn di\ufb00ers from a speci\ufb01c \u02dcbn by a zero-convergent sequence.\u25a0\nHere we consider functions that stem from the model assumptions. Ad-\nditionally, we distinguish the following cases.\nCase 1. Support of \u03b3 is a bounded set: \u00af\u03b6 < \u221e.\nCase 2. The function \u03c6\u22121 satis\ufb01es (5).\nCase 3. The function \u03c6 \u2208OM.\nLemma 1 Under Assumptions 1-3\n(i) the products \u03b3\u03c6 and \u03b3 \u02d9\u03c6 are de\ufb01ned in T \u2032 and in D\u2032;\n(ii) for \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 = \u03c6\u22121(\u03b6)I(|\u03b6| < \u00af\u03b6) the product (\u03b3\u03c6) \u00b7 \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 is always de\ufb01ned\nin D\u2032;\n12\n(iii) if either case 1 applies or both cases 2 and 3 apply the product (\u03b3\u03c6) \u00b7\n\u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 is de\ufb01ned in T \u2032;\n(iv) if neither case 1 nor case 2 applies the product may not be de\ufb01ned in\nT \u2032.\nProof. See Appendix.\nFrom Lemma 1 existence of products to justify the convolution theorem\nand thus equations (3,4) follows. The mapping (8) involves solving equations\n(3,4) for the unknown functions and requires multiplication by \u03c6\u22121; as one\ncan see from Lemma 1 existence of such products in T \u2032 is not guaranteed.\n2.2\nThe nonparametric identi\ufb01cation theorem\nThis section contains two results. The \ufb01rst is Theorem 1 that proves the\nexistence of the identi\ufb01cation mapping M\u2217under Assumptions 1-3. It di\ufb00ers\nfrom the statement in (S, Theorem 1) in three ways: \ufb01rst, Assumption 1\n(and even the more restrictive Assumption 1\u2019) of this paper is more general;\nsecond, it does not rely on decomposition of generalized functions3; third, it\nprovides the condition under which the mapping is obtained via operations\nin the space T \u2032 and discusses the continuity of the identi\ufb01cation mapping.\nThe second result is Proposition 2 that shows that when continuity holds,\nconsistent (in the topology of T \u2032) plug-in non-parametric estimation of the\nregression function is possible, e.g. for functions in space L1.\nTheorem 1 For functions satisfying model assumptions and Assumptions\n1-3 the mapping M\u2217in (7) exists and provides identi\ufb01cation for g; if condi-\ntions of (iii) of Lemma 1 are satis\ufb01ed the mapping is de\ufb01ned via operations\nin T \u2032; it can be discontinuous under condition (iv) of Lemma 1.\nProof. See Appendix.\n3There is no known decomposition in the space of generalized functions into generalized\nfunctions corresponding to ordinary functions and to singular functions, claimed in (S);\nthe pointwise argument provided in (S, 2007, Supplementary Material) is incorrect (see\nAppendix B).\n13\nThe implication of this Theorem is that the identi\ufb01cation result holds\nunder the general assumptions 1-3. If \u03c6 is too thin-tailed, however, the map-\nping whereby the identi\ufb01cation is achieved may not be continuous: this point\nis illustrated by the example in the proof of Theorem 1 where high frequency\ncomponents bn are magni\ufb01ed by multiplication with \u03c6\u22121 from a thin-tailed\ndistribution; this produces inverse Fourier Transforms that diverge.\nContinuity requires that the mapping M given by the model assumptions\nbe continuous in T \u2032. Continuity in T \u2032 allows for a consistent (in T \u2032) plug-in\nestimator; the following Proposition provides su\ufb03cient conditions. Denote by\n\u2192T \u2032 convergence in topology of T \u2032. Following Gel\u2019fand and Vilenkin (1964)\nwe de\ufb01ne a random generalized function as the random continuous functional\non the space of test functions.\nProposition 2 (a) Under the conditions of Theorem 1 suppose that\nWyn, Wxyn are random generalized functions (estimators) that satisfy model\nassumptions and Assumptions 1-3 together with some (unknown) functions\ngn, Fn; condition (iii) of Lemma 1 is satis\ufb01ed; \u03c6n \u2208OM; for \u03b5yn = Ft(Wyn),\n\u03b5xyn = Ft(Wxyn) assume that the Fourier transforms satisfy: \u03b5yn(\u03b6) is con-\ntinuous and non-zero a.e. on supp(\u03b3) and i\u03b5xyn(\u03b6) \u2212\u02d9\u03b5yn(\u03b6) is continuous\nand that\nPr(\u03b5yn(\u03b6)\n\u2192\nT \u2032\u03b5y(\u03b6)) \u21921;\n(13)\nPr(\u03b5xyn(\u03b6)\n\u2192\nT \u2032\u03b5xy(\u03b6)) \u21921,\nthen it is possible to \ufb01nd a sequence gn(x) such that Pr(gn(x) \u2192T \u2032 g(x)) \u21921.\n(b) Suppose that the function g(x) \u2208L1. Then there exists a sequence of\nstep function estimators, gn, such that\nPr(gn(x) \u2192T \u2032 g(x)) \u21921.\nProof. See Appendix.\nConvergence of the estimators is in the weak topology of space T \u2032 of\n14\ngeneralized functions, not in L1. If gn(x) \u2192T \u2032 g(x) and g(x) is a continuous\nfunction then there is pointwise convergence and uniform convergence on\nbounded sets.\n3\nSemiparametric speci\ufb01cation and identi\ufb01-\ncation\nSemiparametric models with measurement error were examined for polyno-\nmial regression functions by Hausman et al (1991), for regression function in\nthe L1 space by Wang and Hsiao (1995, 2009). (S) signi\ufb01cantly widened the\nclasses of semiparametric models with errors-in-variables where identi\ufb01cation\ncan be achieved via moment conditions by utilizing generalized functions, but\ndid not explicitly characterize the class of functions which she considered:\nverifying moment conditions of (S, Assumption 6) is needed. In contrast, the\nclass of parametric functions is characterized directly in Assumptions 5 and 6\nof this paper; the assumptions give su\ufb03cient conditions for identi\ufb01cation via\nmoments. The results in (S) rely on existence of a moment generating func-\ntion for the measurement error; this restriction in not imposed here. In this\npaper as well as in (S) some moment conditions involve limits for sequences\nof weighting functions; the limits are explicitly given here.\nAssumption 4. The function g(x\u2217) is in a parametric class of locally\nintegrable functions g(x\u2217, \u03b8) where \u03b8 \u2208\u0398; \u0398 is an open set in Rm; for some\n\u03b8\u2217\u2208\u0398 model assumptions and (1) hold.\nDenote all the Fourier transforms of the parametric functions in the\nmodel assumptions as \u03b3(\u03b8); \u03b5y(\u03b8); \u03b5xy(\u03b8). The following assumption restricts\nthe generalized function \u03b3(\u03b8) to have no more than a \ufb01nite number of special\npoints: \u2206points of singularity and J of \u201djump\u201d discontinuity in some region\n|\u03b6| < \u00af\u03b6 < \u221e.

By Proposition 1 it follows that since\n\u03c6,\n\u00b7\n\u03c6 \u2208T \u2032, (12) holds for continuous functions \u03c6 and\n\u00b7\n\u03c6 then \u03b3\u03c6 \u2208T \u2032,\n\u00b7\u03b3\u03c6 \u2208T \u2032\nand additionally (by applying the product rule to (3,4)) \u03b3 \u02d9\u03c6 \u2208T \u2032. Since\nT \u2032 \u2282D\u2032, the products are de\ufb01ned in D\u2032 as well.\n(ii) Now consider a sequence (\u03b3\u03c6)n de\ufb01ned as follows: select some se-\nquence \u02dc\u03b3n for \u03b3 from D; then each \u02dc\u03b3n has \ufb01nite support; for a sequence of\nnumbers \u03b5n \u21920 select \u02dc\u03c6n in D such that\n\f\f\f\u02dc\u03c6n \u2212\u03c6\n\f\f\f <\n\u03b5n\nsup|\u02dc\u03b3n\u03c6\u22121| on compact\nsupport of \u03b3n. Then for the sequence (\u03b3\u03c6)n = \u02dc\u03b3n\u02dc\u03c6n and any \u03c8 \u2208D\nZ\n\u02dc\u03b3n\u02dc\u03c6n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8 =\nZ\n\u02dc\u03b3n\u03c8 +\nZ\n\u02dc\u03b3n(\u02dc\u03c6n \u2212\u03c6)\u03c6\u22121\u03c8 \u2192\nZ\n\u03b3\u03c8.\nNow we check that (12) holds for a = \u03c6\u22121. In D support of any \u03c8 is bounded,\non that compact set \u03c6\u22121 is bounded thus (12) will hold and the product is\n20\nde\ufb01ned in D\u2032.\n(iii) For Case 1 the product with \u03c6\u22121(\u03b6)I(|\u03b6| < \u00af\u03b6) is similarly to (ii)\nde\ufb01ned in T \u2032 since it is su\ufb03cient to consider \u03c8 \u2208T with bounded support\n(containing support of \u03b3). If cases 2 and 3 hold it is straightforward to verify\nthat the function \u03c6\u22121 is in OM, thus the product is de\ufb01ned (continuously) in\nT \u2032.\n(iv) We construct a counterexample. The function \u03c6(x) = e\u2212x2 does not\nbelong to either case 1 or case 2. The product of function b(x) \u22610 and\n\u03c6(x)\u22121 does not exist in T \u2032. Consider bn(x) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ne\u2212n\nif n \u22121\nn < x < n + 1\nn;\n0 \u2264bn(x) \u2264e\u2212n\nif n \u22122\nn < x < n + 2\nn;\n0\notherwise.\n(22)\nThis bn(x) converges to b(x) \u22610 in T \u2032. Indeed for any \u03c8 \u2208T\nZ\nbn(x)\u03c8(x)dx =\nZ n+2/n\nn\u22122/n\nbn(x)\u03c8(x)dx \u21920.\nBut the sequence bn(x)\u02dc\u03c6(x)\u22121 does not converge in the space T \u2032 of tem-\npered distributions.\nIndeed if it did then\nR\nbn\u02dc\u03c6\u03c8 would converge for any\n\u03c8 \u2208T.

It proceeds in two parts.\nFirst in part one, it is shown that from equations (3,4) the continuous\n21\nfunction \u03ba = \u02d9\u03c6\u03c6\u22121 can be uniquely pointwise determined on the interval\n[\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6] (which is in the support of \u03b3 and consequently of \u03b51); this requires\nadditionally considering the generalized functions spaces, D\u2032 and also D0(U)\u2032\nwhich is de\ufb01ned on the space of test functions that are continuous with\nsupport contained in U. The function \u03c6 is uniquely de\ufb01ned on the interval\n(\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6) as the solution of the corresponding di\ufb00erential equation that sat-\nis\ufb01es the condition \u03c6(0) = 1. De\ufb01ne \u02dc\u03c6 = \u03c6I(|\u03b6| < \u00af\u03b6); de\ufb01ne \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 to equal\n\u03c6\u22121I(|\u03b6| < \u00af\u03b6). Of course, when \u00af\u03b6 = \u221e, \u02dc\u03c6 = \u03c6 and \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 = \u03c6\u22121 on R.\nNext in part two, \u03b3 is de\ufb01ned as \u03b5y\u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121. By Lemma 1 this product can\nalways be uniquely de\ufb01ned as a generalized function in D\u2032; by construction \u03b3\nde\ufb01nes a generalized function in T \u2032 \u2282D\u2032; this provides the required mapping\nM\u2217by applying inverse Fourier Transform to \u03b3. If condition (iii) of Lemma\n1 applies the product \u03b5y\u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 is de\ufb01ned in T \u2032; in this case all the mappings\nthat de\ufb01ne the mapping M\u2217are de\ufb01ned in T \u2032. The proof concludes with an\nexample that demonstrates that the mapping can be discontinuous if (iv) of\nLemma 1 applies.\nPart one. Consider the space of generalized functions D\u2032. By Assumption\n2 \u03c6 is non-zero and continuously di\ufb00erentiable, then by di\ufb00erentiating (3),\nsubstituting (4) and making use of Lemma 1 to multiply by \u03c6\u22121 in D\u2032 we get\nthat the generalized function\n\u03b5y\u03c6\u22121 \u02d9\u03c6 \u2212(\u02d9\u03b5y \u2212i\u03b5xy)\nequals zero in the sense of generalized function in D\u2032. Denoting \u03ba = \u02d9\u03c6\u03c6\u22121 we\ncan characterize \u03ba as a continuous at every point (by Assumption 2) function\nin D\u2032 that satis\ufb01es the equation\n\u03b5y\u03ba \u2212(\u02d9\u03b5y \u2212i\u03b5xy) = 0.\n(23)\nIf (23) holds in D\u2032, it holds also for any test functions with support limited\nto U : \u03c8 \u2208D(U) \u2282D, and thus holds in any D(U)\u2032.\n22\nWe show that the function \u03ba is uniquely determined in the class of con-\ntinuous functions on on [\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6] by (23) holding in D(U)\u2032 for any interval\nU \u2282(\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6). Proof is by contradiction. Suppose that there are two distinct\ncontinuous functions on [\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6], \u03ba1 \u0338= \u03ba2 that satisfy (23), then \u03ba1(\u00afx) \u0338= \u03ba2(\u00afx)\nfor some \u00afx \u2208(\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6); by continuity \u03ba1 \u0338= \u03ba2 everywhere for some interval\nU \u2282(\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6). Consider now D(U)\u2032; we can write\n(\u03b5y(\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2), \u03c8) = 0\nfor any \u03c8 \u2208D(U). A generalized function that is zero for all \u03c8 \u2208D(U)\ncoincides with the ordinary zero function on U and is also zero for all \u03c8 \u2208\nD0(U), where D0 denotes the space of continuous test functions. For the\nspace of test function D0(U) multiplication by continuous (\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2) \u0338= 0 is\nan isomorphism. Then from (23) we can write\n0 = ([\u03b5y(\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2)] , \u03c8) = (\u03b5y, (\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2)\u03c8)\nimplying that \u03b5y is de\ufb01ned and is a zero generalized function in D0(U)\u2032. If\nthat were so \u03b5y would be a zero generalized function in D(U)\u2032 since D(U) \u2282\nD0(U); this contradicts Assumption 2. This concludes the \ufb01rst part of the\nproof since from \u03ba the function\n\u03c6(\u03b6) = exp\nZ \u03b6\n0\n\u03ba(\u03be)d\u03be\nthat solves on [\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6]\n\u02d9\u03c6\u03c6\u22121 = \u03ba; \u03c6(0) = 1\nis uniquely determined on [\u2212\u00af\u03b6, \u00af\u03b6] and \u02dc\u03c6 (and \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121) de\ufb01ned above are uniquely\ndetermined.\nPart two.\nConsider two cases.\n23\nCase 1.Part (iii) of Lemma 1 applies. Multiplying \u03b5y(= \u03b3\u02dc\u03c6) by \u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 pro-\nvides a tempered distribution by Lemma 1; it is equal to \u03b3. The inverse\nFourier Transform provides g. The theorem holds and moreover, all the op-\nerations by which the solution was obtained were de\ufb01ned in T \u2032.\nCase 2. The condition (iii) of Lemma 1 may not hold, so multiplication by\n\u02dc\u03c6\n\u22121 = \u03c6\u22121 may not lead to a tempered distribution. Consider now D\u2032; T \u2032 \u2282\nD\u2032. Multiplication by \u03c6\u22121 is a continuous operation in D\u2032; de\ufb01ne the same\ndi\ufb00erential equations, solve to obtain \u03c6 and get via multiplication (\u03b3\u03c6) \u00b7 \u03c6\u22121\nin D\u2032 the function \u03b3 \u2208D\u2032. Since \u03b3 is the Fourier transform of g (a tempered\ndistribution) it also belongs to T \u2032, and it is possible to recover g by an inverse\nFourier Transform.\nIn the following example the mapping M\u2217in (7) is not continuous. De\ufb01ne\n\u03b2n = Ft\u22121(bn) where bn is de\ufb01ned by (22); bn \u2208T, thus \u03b2n \u2208T. In was shown\nin proof of Lemma 1 that bn(x) converges to b(x) \u22610 in T \u2032.\nSuppose that the model mapping M in (6) is de\ufb01ned for functions in L1\nand is continuous in L1 (and thus in T \u2032). Suppose that Wyn = Wy + \u03b2n;\nfrom bn \u21920 in T \u2032 and the continuity of the Fourier Transform mapping in\nT \u2032, it follows that \u03b2n \u21920 and thus Wyn \u2192Wy in T \u2032. Then \u03b5yn = \u03b5y + bn.\nSuppose that \u03c6 is proportionate to e\u2212x2. Then by the proof in part 1 each\n\u03b3n = \u03b5yn\u03c6\u22121 \u2208D\u2032, but as a Ft of a function in T \u2032 (even in L1 here) is de\ufb01ned\nin T \u2032; the inverse Fourier transform, \u02dcgn = Ft\u22121(\u03b3n), exists. However, \u02dcgn does\nnot converge to g in T \u2032. Indeed, if it did so converge, then that would imply\nconvergence \u03b3n \u2192\u03b3 in T \u2032, but bn(x)ex2 does not converge in the space T \u2032 of\ntempered distributions as was shown in the proof of Lemma 1. \u25a0\nProof of Proposition 2.\n(a) We establish that the mapping from (Wyn, Wxyn) to gn is continuous.\nConsider \u03b6 \u2208supp(\u03b3). Similarly to proof in Theorem 1 applied to every n a\ncontinuous function \u03ban(\u03b6), that satis\ufb01es the equation\n\u03ban(\u03b6)\u03b5yn(\u03b6) + (i\u03b5xyn(\u03b6) \u2212\u02d9\u03b5yn(\u03b6)) = 0\n(24)\n24\nin generalized functions, exists (de\ufb01ned as \u02d9\u03c6n\u03c6\u22121\nn ) and is unique. Moreover,\nfrom Lemma 1 it follows that the product with \u03ban = \u02d9\u03c6n\u03c6\u22121\nn\n\u2208OM always\nexists. Since all functions in (24) are continuous it represents an equality of\ncontinuous functions and since \u03b5yn is non-zero a.e. we have\n\u03ban(\u03b6) = (i\u03b5xyn(\u03b6) \u2212\u02d9\u03b5yn(\u03b6))(\u03b5yn(\u03b6))\u22121.\nThe generalized functions\n\u03ban\u03b5yn \u2212\u03ba\u03b5y = i(\u03b5xyn \u2212\u03b5xy) + (\u02d9\u03b5yn \u2212\u02d9\u03b5y) and \u03ban(\u03b5y \u2212\u03b5yn)\nconverge to zero as generalized functions in T \u2032; as a result, so does (\u03ban\u2212\u03ba)\u03b5yn,\nbut since this is a continuous function this implies pointwise convergence.\nSuppose that on some bounded interval \u03ban \u2212\u03ba is separated away from zero\nfor some subsequence {ni}, this implies then that on that set \u03b5yni converges\nto zero pointwise, thus the limit in T \u2032 (=\u03b5y) is zero on this interval which\nbelongs to support of \u03b3, and thus of \u03b5y. This contradiction establishes that\n\u03ban \u2192\u03ba pointwise and uniformly on any bounded set. From the di\ufb00erential\nequation \u03c6\u22121\nn \u02d9\u03c6n = \u03ban with the condition \u03c6n(0) = 1 the function \u03c6n is uniquely\ndetermined; and \u03c6n \u2192\u03c6 where \u03c6\u22121 \u02d9\u03c6 = \u03ba, \u03c6(0) = 1. Then also since \u03c6 is non-\nzero, \u03c6\u22121\nn \u2192\u03c6\u22121 pointwise; \u03c6\u22121\nn\nsatis\ufb01es (5) so that \u03b51n\u03c6\u22121\nn\ncan be de\ufb01ned as\na tempered distribution. Finally consider\n\u03b5yn\u03c6\u22121\nn \u2212\u03b5y\u03c6\u22121 = \u03b5yn(\u03c6\u22121\nn \u2212\u03c6\u22121) + (\u03b5yn \u2212\u03b5y)\u03c6\u22121.\nThe continuous function \u03b5yn(\u03c6\u22121\nn \u2212\u03c6\u22121) \u21920; the generalized function (\u03b5yn \u2212\n\u03b5y)\u03c6\u22121 \u21920 in T \u2032 (as a tempered distribution) \u03b5yn\u03c6\u22121\nn\nconverges to \u03b3 in T \u2032,\nand its inverse Fourier Transform converges to g as a tempered distribution\n(by continuity of inverse Fourier Transform in T \u2032).\nFrom continuity of the mapping the result follows.\n(b) For any g \u2208L1 there exists a sequence of step-functions gn \u2208L1\nsuch that \u2225gn \u2212g\u2225L1 \u21920 (implying gn \u2192T \u2032 g); for F there is a sequence of\n25\nstep-functions Fn such that sup |Fn \u2212F| \u21920 (implying Fn \u2192T \u2032 F).\nSpeci\ufb01cally,\ngn(x)\n=\nN\nX\nk=1\nakI(bk \u2264x < bk+1) for b1 < ... < bN;\nFn(x)\n=\nN\nX\nj=1\ncjI(dj \u2264x) with cj > 0; \u03a3cj = 1; d1 < ... < dN,\nwhere all the parameters depend on n. The generalized derivative of Fn is\nfn(x) = \u03a3cj\u03b4(x \u2212dj) where \u03b4(x \u2212dj) is a shifted \u03b4\u2212function:\nR\n\u03b4(x \u2212\ndj)\u03c8(x)dx = \u03c8(di) for \u03c8 \u2208T. Then \u03c6n(\u03b6) = \u03a3cjei\u03b6dj. The function \u03c6n is\nnot integrable (otherwise f would be continuous), thus \u03c6\u22121\nn\nsatis\ufb01es (5). All\nthe parameters depend on n.\nThen\nWyn(v)\n=\nN2\nX\nm=1\n\u03b1mI(|v \u2212tm| < \u03c4 m);\nWxyn(v)\n=\nN2\nX\nm=1\n\u03b1m(v \u2212\u03b5m)I(|v \u2212tm| < \u03c4 m),\nwhere m corresponds to a pair (k, j) and \u03b1m = akcj; tm = dj + bk+bk+1\n2\n, \u03b5m =\ndj, \u03c4 m = bk+1\u2212bk\n2\n. This represents Wyn as a step-function and Wxyn as a piece-\nwise linear function. The conditional mean function Wy can be consistently\nestimated in L1 by step functions implying existence of a sequence Wyn(v)\nsuch that Pr(Wyn \u2192T \u2032 Wy) \u21921, similarly, for some piece-wise linear Wxyn(v)\nPr(Wxyn \u2192T \u2032 Wxy) \u21921 implying (13), moreover, we can write (using known\n26\nFourier transforms)\n\u03b5yn(\u03b6)\n=\nN\nX\nk=1\n2\u03c4 k\u03b1k\u03c7k(\u03b6)sinc(\u03c4 k\u03b6\n\u03c0 );\n\u03b5xyn(\u03b6)\n=\n\u2212i\nN\nX\nk=1\n2\u03c4 k\nd\nd\u03b6\n\u0014\n\u03b1k\u03c7k(\u03b6)sinc(\u03c4 k\u03b6\n\u03c0 )\n\u0015\n\u2212\nN\nX\nk=1\n2\u03c4 k\u03b1k\u03b5k\u03c7k(\u03b6)sinc(\u03c4 k\u03b6\n\u03c0 ),\nwhere the sinc(x) function is de\ufb01ned as sin \u03c0x\n\u03c0x\nand \u03c7k(\u03b6) = eitk\u03b6.

Denote by TR \u2282T the space of real test functions that are Ft of real-\nvalued functions from T; they satisfy \u03c8(\u2212\u03b6) = \u03c8(\u03b6).

Below all relevant functions are subscripted by\nl.\nFor \u03b5 as de\ufb01ned in (i) de\ufb01ne the function \u00b5l,i(\u03b6) = fsl,i,\u03b5(\u03b6) \u2208TR, then\n\u00b5(i)\nl,i (0) \u0338= 0, but \u00b5(k)\nl,i (0) = 0, k = 0, ...i \u22121, i + 1, ...\u00afk + 1 and support of\n\u00b5l,i is given by I(|\u03b6 \u2212sl| < \u03b5) + I(|\u03b6 + sl| < \u03b5); denote the derivative of \u00b5l,i\nby \u00b5\u2032\nl,i. For a sequence \u03b5n \u21920 consider fVn(\u03b6) for Un = {\u03b6 : |\u03b6 \u2212sl| <\n\u03b5n} \u222a{\u03b6 : |\u03b6 + sl| < \u03b5n}; Vn = {\u03b6 : |\u03b6 \u2212sl| \u2264\n\u03b5n\n2 } \u222a{\u03b6 : |\u03b6 + sl| <\n\u03b5n\n2 }\n30\nand de\ufb01ne \u00b5l,i,n(\u03b6) = \u00b5li(\u03b6)fUn,Vn(\u03b6)). The functions \u00b5\u00b7 are in TR. Denote\nby rxys,l,i,n(z) the inverse Ft: Ft\u22121(\u00b5l,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)) and by rys,l,i,n(z) the inverse\nFt: Ft\u22121(i\u00b5\u2032\nl,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)); they exist in T. The vector rxys,l,n(z) is de\ufb01ned to have\nrxys,l,i,n(z) as its i\u2212th component; vector rys,l,n(z) is de\ufb01ned similarly. De\ufb01ne\nby Ml the diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal entries {Ml}ii = \u00b5(i)\nl,i,n(0) \u2261\n\u00b5(i)\nl,i (0), i = 0, ...\u00afk.\nConsider now the vector (\u03b5y, \u00b5\u2032\nl,n) with components (\u03b5y, \u00b5\u2032\nl,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)) and\n(\u03b5xy, \u00b5l,n) with (\u03b5xy, \u00b5l,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)). Since the matrices \u0393y(sl, \u03b8), \u0393xy(sl, \u03b8) and\nMl are invertible the expression\n\u0393y(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n(\u03b5y, \u00b5\u2032\nl,n) + \u0393xy(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n(\u03b5xy, \u00b5l,n)\n(28)\nis \ufb01nite for every n. By Parseval identity\n(\u03b5y(\u03b6), \u00b5\u2032\nl,i,n(\u2212\u03b6))\n=\n(Wy(z), ry,l,i,n(z))\n=\nZ\nWy(z)ry,l,i,n(z)dz,\nthe last equality follows since Wy is locally integrable. Thus by arguments\nsimilar to those in (i) and (ii) this integral is E Y ry,l,i,n(z)\np(z)\nso that (\u03b5y, \u00b5\u2032\nl,n) =\nE Y ry,l,n(z)\np(z)\nand analogously (\u03b5xy, \u00b5l,n) = E XY rxy,l,n(z)\np(z)\n. We need to establish\nthat limits as n \u2192\u221eexist. First, note that\n\f\f\f\f\nZ\n\u03b5yo(\u03b6)\u00b5\u2032\nl,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)d\u03b6\n\f\f\f\f\n=\n\f\f\f\f\nZ\n\u03b5yo(\u03b6)f\u03b6l,i,\u03b5(\u2212\u03b6)fUn,Vn(\u2212\u03b6)d\u03b6\n\f\f\f\f\n\u2264\nmax\nU\n\f\f\u03b5yo(\u03b6)f\u03b6l,i,\u03b5(\u2212\u03b6)\n\f\f 2\u03b5n\nand goes to zero;\n(\u03b5ys, \u00b5\u2032\nl,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)) = \u03a3\n\u00afk\nk\u2265i\u03b3(sl, \u03b8\u2217)(\u22121)i\n \nk + i \u22121\ni \u22121\n!\n\u00b5(i)\nl,i (sl)\u03c6(k\u2212i+1)(sl) (29)\nand does not depend on n, \ufb01nally, \u03b5y = \u03b5yo + \u03b5ys, so the limit exists. By a\n31\nsimilar representation for \u2212(\u03b5xys, \u00b5l,i,n(\u2212\u03b6)) existence of (19) is established.\nFor \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2217using (25,26) for \u03b5ys and \u03b5xys in (28) leads to\n\u0393y(sl, \u03b8\u2217)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n(\u03b5ys, \u00b5\u2032\nl,n) + \u0393xy(sl, \u03b8\u2217)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n(\u03b5xys, \u00b5l,n) = 0.\nNote that the same considerations apply to singularity at \u2212sl with the dif-\nference that the \u0393.(\u2212sl, \u03b8) matrices now are complex conjugate to \u0393.(sl, \u03b8).\nCombining provides the real part in (19).\n(iv) Consider the \ufb01rst component of \u0393y(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n(\u03b5ys, \u00b5\u2032\nl,n) with \u00b5\u2032\nl,n, Ml\nde\ufb01ned in (iii); this component is {\u0393y(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n}11(\u03b5ys, \u00b5\u2032\nl,1,n). Note that\n\u00b5\u2032\nl,1,n = \u00b5l,0,n, recall that \u00b5 \u2208TR. We see that \u03c6(sl) equals lim{\u0393y(sl, \u03b8\u2217)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n}11\nR\n\u03b5ys\u00b5l,0,nd\u03b6.\nDe\ufb01ne\nrysl,1,n(z, \u03b8) = {\u0393y(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n}11Ft\u22121(\u00b5l,0,n(\u2212\u03b6)).\nSimilarly to above by Parseval identity {\u0393y(sl, \u03b8)\u22121M\u22121\nl\n}11(\u03b5ys, \u00b5l,0,n) = E( Y rysl,1,n(z,\u03b8)\np(z)\n)\nand \u03c6(sl) = lim E( Y rysl,1,n(z,\u03b8)\np(z)\n). For s0 = 0 we have \u03c6(0) = 1. Thus (20) fol-\nlows.\nConsider now for sl \u0338= 0 the function\n\u00b5l,n(\u03b6) = 1\n2{fbump(\u03b6 \u2212sl \u2212\u03ben\n\u03b5n\n) + fbump(\u03b6 \u2212sl + \u03ben\n\u03b5n\n)}\nsimilar to the one in (ii) and de\ufb01ne rslo,n(z) = Ft\u22121(\n\u00b5l,n(\u2212\u03b6)\n\u03b3o(\u2212\u03b6,\u03b8)). For this function\nE( Y rslo,n(z,\u03b8)\np(z)\n) =\nR\n\u03b5y(\u03b6)\n\u00b5l,n(\u2212\u03b6)\n\u03b3o(\u2212\u03b6,\u03b8)d\u03b6 exists and at \u03b8\u2217converges to \u03c6(sl). Thus\n(21) follows.\u25a0\nProof of Theorem 3.\nLet the vector Q(z, \u03b8) denote the vector of functions for which expecta-\ntions are taken in E(Q); partition Q(z, \u03b8) into QI(z, \u03b8) corresponding to ex-\npressions in (17, 18) and QII(z, \u03b8) for (19, 21). Then the matrix\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T E(Q(z, \u03b8))\n32\nis a block matrix\n \n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T\nI E(QI(z, \u03b8))\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T\nII E(QII(z, \u03b8))\n!\nand it is su\ufb03cient to show that\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T\nI E(QI(z, \u03b8)) has rank mI and\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T\nII E(QII(z, \u03b8))\nhas rank mII.\nFor \u03b8I \ufb01rst note that interchange of di\ufb00erentiation with respect to the\nparameter and integration (taking expected value) for\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8T\nI EQI(z, \u03b8) follows\nfrom continuity in \u03b6 of all the functions in the integrals and their continuous\ndi\ufb00erentiability with respect to \u03b8, so that\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8I E(QI(z, \u03b8)) = E( \u2202\n\u2202\u03b8I QI(z, \u03b8)).\nOne can choose mI functions \u00b5 de\ufb01ned in proofs of Theorem 2(i,ii) that\nare functionally independent and under Assumption 6 the corresponding mI\nconditions of type E( \u2202\n\u2202\u03b8I QI(z, \u03b8)) will provide a rank mI submatrix.\nIf for the functions \u00b5 in expressions QII(z, \u03b8) in (iii,iv) of Proof of Theorem\n2 the matrix\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8II E(Qs(z, \u03b8)) has rank less than mII consider varying the\nfunctions \u00b5\u00b7 for all possible values of non-zero derivatives at the points sl; the\nrank cannot be de\ufb01cient over all such choices without violation of Assumption\n6.\u25a0\nAppendix B\nThree main problems with (S) are listed below.\n1. The issue of decomposition.\n(S) claims that any generalized function in T \u2032 can be decomposed into a\nsum of an ordinary function and a singular function; this decomposition is\nused in formula (13) of S., Theorem 1.\nThere is no proof of existence of such a decomposition in the literature,\nas the example of the function in Section 2.1 in (10) shows no unique de-\ncomposition into a singular and regular ordinary function exists in T \u2032 (nor in\nD\u2032). The attempted proof in (S, Supplementary material, p.3) is incorrect.\nIndeed it states: \u201dThe result directly follows from the fact that every\ngeneralized function can be written as the derivative of order k \u2208N of some\n33\ncontinuous function c(t) (Theorem III in Temple (1963) establishes this for a\nclass of generalized functions including those considered here as a particular\ncase). [-my comment: this is correct] At every point t where c(t) is k times\ndi\ufb00erentiable in the usual sense, the generalized function can be written as\nan ordinary function, while at every point where c(t) is not k times di\ufb00eren-\ntiable, a delta function derivative is created in the di\ufb00erentiation process.[my\ncomment: this is incorrect, see (a) below] The fact that the two pieces are\nadditively separable follows from the linear nature of the space of generalized\nfunctions. [my comment: this is incorrectly applied: see (b) below]\u201d\n(a). Consider the function b(\u03b6) = |\u03b6|\u22123\n2 ; it is a \u201dweak\u201d (or generalized)\nsecond derivative of the continuous function c(\u03b6) = \u22124 |\u03b6|\n1\n2. The \ufb01rst weak\nderivative, \u22122 |\u03b6|\u22121\n2 sign(\u03b6), is an ordinary function that is summable and\nso gives a regular functional and is an ordinary function that is at the same\ntime a generalized function. At point \u03b6 = 0 it is not di\ufb00erentiable in the\nordinary sense; yet no delta-function or its derivative appears.\n(b) Any generalized function is either regular or singular; the \u201dordinary\u201d\nfunction b(\u03b6) above is a singular generalized function (see (10)). Since gen-\neralized functions are generally not de\ufb01ned pointwise a pointwise argument\ncannot be helpful.\nAn additional assumption would have to be used to establish formula (13)\nin Theorem 1 of (S).\n2. Validity of products.\nValidity of products in the space of generalized functions needs to be\nestablished to provide a correct proof of the identi\ufb01cation result. Neither\nthe paper nor the supplementary material in (S) provides a complete correct\nproof indicating in which space of generalized functions the multiplication\noperations are valid; in fact as Lemma 1 here shows multiplication may not\nbe valid in T \u2032 under the Assumptions (despite the claim in (S)).\n3. De\ufb01nition 2 in (S) leads to inappropriate weights.\n34\nDef. 2 proposes the function\n\u00b5(\u03b6) =\n\u221e\nX\nk=0\n1\nk!dk(\u03b6k\u03bb(\u03b6))/d\u03b6k\nfor \u03bb that satis\ufb01es S, Def. 1 (\u03bb is an analytic function).
